## General Information

### Where does the food come from?  

Our produce is donated to us by several local organisations, including SecondBite. These organisations collect excess or imperfect food that would otherwise go to waste. To ensure our meals are nutritionally balanced, we purchase protein from local markets.

### What types of meals do we make?  

What we make largely depends on what we receive from our donors. We are committed to making wholesome, balanced, nutritious hot meals. Our frequent staples include stews, curries, soups, and stir-fries. We seek feedback from our recipients to ensure we are making meals they enjoy.

### Are the meals nutritious?  

Yes! Nutritious, plant-based hot meals are our specialty. We work with top Australian nutritionists to ensure that they are as wholesome as they are delicious.

### How many meals do you give out per year?  

In 2021, our community of OBK staff and volunteers cooked and distributed over 250,000 meals to people in need across New South Wales.

## Donations & Food

### Can I donate food?  

You may donate food to us; however, the process of accepting donated food from individuals is rather tricky. Between government food regulations and being a kosher kitchen, we cannot always accept the food that is offered to us. That being said, we are always happy to inspect produce to see if we can accept it or not.

### If I need food, how do I get it?
